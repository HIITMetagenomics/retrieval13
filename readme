To generate samples from synthetic data, use generateSamples.m
    - Install metaSim and Jellyfish, check for dependencies explained in the code
    - .mprf files for LOW and HIGH are avaliable
    - Abundance profile of each sample and their class label is available in [LOW/HIGH].abundance.label
    
To reproduce the figures in the paper run fig*.m
    - Check for dependencies in configPaths.m 
    - Each <data>.mat file contains 3 matrices for specific k-mer (K), unspecified k-mer (S), and FIGfam (F)
        - Dimensions of recordK - (3 metrices), (k-mer 12 21 30), (entropies), (not needed), (query)
        - Dimensions of recordS - (3 metrices), (entropies), (not needed), (query)
        - Dimensions of recordF - (3 metrices), (entropies), (length 21 30), (query)
    - Each figure*randomTest.mat file contains results of the random test
        - Description is available within the code
